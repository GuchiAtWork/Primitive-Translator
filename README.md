What is this?

This is a simple translator program that when given a directory, will attempt to translate all files with appropriate extensions 
(only appropriate extension in current program is .txt and .ks). Must be launched using command prompt.

(If anyone stumbles upon this and is interested in using this, note that you must make an account on Microsoft Azure and 
 acquire a key to use their API (depending on how much characters you're translating, you may need to pay))
 
Furthermore, abbreviations are supplied here: https://api.cognitive.microsofttranslator.com/languages?api-version=3.0
